      <p>
        The changes of the last 50 years have rendered the political and social
        world far too complex for most of us to understand. I often call
        democracy the broadest and most complex relationship you can never have.
        Unlike academics and scholars whose understanding of these issues come
        mostly from research and the deliberation of abstract ideas, most of my
        insights were first triggered by excruciating first-hand experience. I
        have been extraordinarily privileged to be able to help people
        understand their own thinking processes, and to work with them when they
        are at their most vulnerable. This has given me a deep appreciation of
        what it takes for us humans to get along with each other (and
        ourselves). Every functional relationship, I have come to realize, is a
        miracle of love, patience, and compromise.

        MetaCultureâ€™s courses are committed to developing intelligent and
        thoughtful citizens who can help sustain our extremely vulnerable
        societies. A lifetime of working with groups and communities (to
        strengthen their collaboration and conflict management processes) has
        taught me that sustainable communities depend more on the culture and
        character of their people than on technocrats with their clever attempts
        at developing policies, legislation, or social engineering. These
        courses are designed for those who are willing to question themselves,
        their assumptions, and their solutions for all the ills of the world.
